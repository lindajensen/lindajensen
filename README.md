About me
Highly motivated and self-taught web developer in the midst of a career jump. Even though I haven't worked in the field yet I'm hoping to bring my creative mindset and problem-solving skills into the world of coding. I'm committed to continuous learning and growth and can't wait to apply everything I've learned in a professional setting.
