<h1 align="left">Hello 👋🏼 I'm Linda!</h1>

<p align="left">A tech-loving teacher who's trying to  become a web developer 💫</p>

<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">Highly motivated and self-taught (soon to be) web developer in the midst of a career jump. Even though I haven't worked in the field yet I'm hoping to bring my creative mindset and problem-solving skills into the world of coding. I'm committed to continuous learning and growth and can't wait to apply everything I've learned in a professional setting.<br><br>PS. If you have a look at "Languages and Tools" and you go "Well, that doesn't seem like a lot"... let me just tell you that I never coded a day in my life before August of 2023. Taking that into account, I'd say that's pretty badass.</p>

###

<p align="left">📚 I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>🎯 Goals: Learn as much as possible about web development in the next year (August 2024 here I come). Start working as web developer (probably front-end, but keeping all doors open) within the next few years.<br>📬 You can reach me: Via LinkedIn or email.<br>🎈 Fun fact: I am currently trying to learn Arabic.</p>
